	<h2> Lab Goals </h2>
	<p> The focus of this lab was about maintaining an organized file structure and
		using files from one part of it in another. </p>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p> It wasn't very difficult, but
		the closest thing to a challenge I encountered was getting a screenshot
		of my index.html page. I thought it would show up as the main page of
		my website, but no, I had to type in the index.html URL to find it.
		Still not sure how to make that what shows up by default. </p>
	<h2> Results </h2>
	<p> I think I made a competent site, though. Not a flashy one or even
		something that looks average in today's era of WordPress and SquareSpace,
		but a competent site that does what it needs to. Given enough time,
		I now believe I could make a site that actually looks great by modern standards,
		and that's what matters more than the site itself. </p>
