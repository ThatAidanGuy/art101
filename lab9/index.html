		<h1> Lab 9: JavaScript and the Web </h1>
		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The challenge of this lab is to use DOM manipulation to make HTML, CSS,
		and JavaScript work together, like friends and not enemies.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> This was a very straightforward lab. I had some trouble getting elements
		to show up via the .appendChild() method, however. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I realized that I was trying to append both variables in div1
		on a single call of .appendChild(). By doing it twice, one variable per
		function call, I was able to make my program work as intended. </p>
