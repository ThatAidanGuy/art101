		<p> My partner for this assignment is Nailea. He enjoys drawing artwork in different mediums.
		He's also somewhat experienced in HTML, CSS etc. but not yet an expert.
		Combine these two facts and this class seems like a great fit.
		One of his favorite video games is <i> Stardew Valley </i>. </p>
