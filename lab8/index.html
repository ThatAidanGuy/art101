		<h1> Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>
		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The goal of this lab is to experiment a bit with anonymous Functions
		and call backs.</p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> It was challenging to get the JavaScript to show up alongside the HTML.
		However, I got that to work. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I was able to output JS as long as the divs I accessed in the
		getElementById code preceded the script src.</p>
