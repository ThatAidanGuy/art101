		<h1> Lab 6: Arrays and Objects </h1>
		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> Create a webpage using JavaScript arrays and objects. </p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> Neither of us were at section with a computer, so we had to meet
			after class on Zoom. One of us was also unsure how to access the Console
			in Google Chrome. And we werenâ€™t able to get the JavaScript to show up. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> We scheduled a time for a Zoom call after class and helped each other
		 	figure out anything we were unsure how to do, such as accessing Chrome's
			JavaScript Console. Cassie turned in the assignment on time with the
			JavaScript not working, while Aidan turned in the assignment late with
			the writeln code changed to getElementById, which got the JavaScript
			to show up successfully.</p>
