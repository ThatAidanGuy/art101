		<h1> Lab 7: Functions </h1>
		<h2> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The challenge of this lab is to use a function to manipulate text. </p>
		<h2> Problems </h2>
		<p> Most of my problems came from implementing CSS.
		 	I had to tweak many aspects of the hot dog image until I was satisfied with it.
		 	I also wasn't sure which of the extra tasks to take on. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> I decided to place the hot dog image on the left side of the screen
		 	and have it scale with the user's window size.
			I decided to also attempt 2 of the extra tasks, sorting capital letters
			and filtering out spaces, deciding against attempting more (at least before
			submitting the assignment) for the sake of turning it in on time. </p>
