		<h1> Lab 5: Data Types and Variables </h1>
		<p> <b> Description:</b> Working with your partner, experiment with basic
			JavaScript data types and variables. </p>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> Because we are both familiar with JavaScript already, we had minimal
			issues getting our websites working. The distinction between writeIn with
			an I and writeln with an L is somewhat confusing because of camelCase
			but itâ€™s an easy fix. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> We have screenshots in the PDF we submitted. Furthermore, you are reading
			this web page as proof that it was made successfully. </p>
