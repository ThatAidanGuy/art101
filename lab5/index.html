		<h1> Lab 5: Data Types and Variables </h1>
		<p> <b> Description:</b> Working with your partner, experiment with basic
			JavaScript data types and variables. </p>
		<h2> Challenges </h2>
		<p> Because we are both familiar with JavaScript already, we had minimal
			issues getting our websites working. The distinction between writeIn with
			an I and writeln with an L is somewhat confusing because of camelCase
			but itâ€™s an easy fix. </p>
		<h2> Results </h2>
		<p> We have screenshots in the PDF we submitted. Furthermore, you are reading
			this web page as proof that it was made successfully. </p>
		<div>
			<h2> Script Output </h2>
			<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
		</div>

		<h2> Super Extra Project: Input Your Car </h2>
		<p> We decided to make an extra feature for this lab because
			it was very simple and short for us. Input your car's details below
			and we will format the data into a sentence! </p>
			<p> Make: <input type="text" id="uMake"></p>
			<p> Model: <input type="text" id="uModel"></p>
			<p> Color: <input type="text" id="uColor"></p>
			<p> Year: <input type="number" id="uYear"></p>
			<button onclick="createCar()">Submit</button>
			<script src="js/extra.js"></script>
